# WFWCleanup - Cleanup ALL Windows 10 firewall rules for Public profile

##Purpose of this tool

Some new Windows 10 firewall rules like:

    @{Microsoft.PPIProjection_10.0.15063.0_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewy?ms-resource://Microsoft.PPIProjection/resources/ProductName}

are not seen in the standart UI and it`s not easy to remove or disable them.

In some cases you need to disconnect Wi-Fi first.
